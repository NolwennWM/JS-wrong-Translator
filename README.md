# JS Translator

A little project joke to translate text into [JS*uck](https://jsfuck.com/)â€”because why not?
For the moment it only translates text, but maybe one day it will execute JS code too.
If I have time and motivation for improve a joke project.^^"

## What is JS*uck?

JS*uck is an esoteric and obfuscated JavaScript dialect using only six characters: `[]()!+`. It can encode any JavaScript code, including readable text, into this minimal character set.

## Features

- Convert plain text to JS*uck representation
- Simple and fun interface

## Getting Started

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NolwennWM/JS-wrong-Translator.git
```

Then just open the HTML in a browser or with a local server.

## Why?

Just for fun! This project is a playful experiment with JS*uck encoding.

## TODO

- [ ] Improve the user interface
- [ ] Implement JS code execution
- [ ] Write tests
